# Booklistapp with different technologies

Same simple web application done using different technologies.

I am using it as a teaching material to show how the same functionality can be
done using different technologies and demonstrating that each technology stack
is fit for different use case.

## Technologies

* [Good ol' plain PHP](php-plain)
* [PHP + Laravel](php-laravel)
* Node.js + Express (in progress)
* Python + Django (in progress)

## The app

* list of books fetched from Sqlite database
* link to delete any of the books
* text input and submit button for adding new book

Here's a simple screencast:
